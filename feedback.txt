This is an excellent essay about quantum communication complexity which clearly summarises some of the major advances in this area. The author makes a good selection of topics to cover and explains them well, including quite a number of technical details. Although the proof of the main result covered (Theorem 3.4) follows similar lines to the proof in the original paper, some additional steps are included and it seems clear that the author has understood the result well. There is also some evidence of novelty: the author has given an apparently new (or at least more detailed) proof of Theorem 3.2 and has also corrected a minor slip in a known complexity bound on the distributed Deutsch-Jozsa problem. The essay is well-written, pleasant to read and could form a useful reference for someone new to the area.

There are only a couple of areas in which the essay does not reach the absolute highest standard. First, there are some technical mistakes and omissions (detailed below); and second, the novel aspects of the essay do not seem to be of a particularly high level of technical difficulty. So the essay does not seem to quite reach the level of potential publishability required for the highest category of marks.

Some specific comments:

- p1-2: the introduction to the communication complexity model would be clearer if it stated explicitly what the requirements are on probability of error for different models (for example, failure probability at most 1/3); and also that Alice and Bob are allowed to use randomness.

- p2, end of Sec 2.1: "Section 2" -> "Section 3"?

- p3, Theorem 2.1: I think O(2^m) should be m.

- p3, Sec 3.1: x \in 0,1^n: missing braces around 0,1.

- p4, end of page: "completeness" and "soundness" are used here without having been defined.

- p4, end of page: the logical implication "If we can find a total subgroup membership function that cannot classically be solved using O(log |G|) bits of communication, then we will have a quadratic gap" isn't right -- for example, there could be a function that can be computed classically using O(log^{3/2} |G|) bits, giving a subquadratic gap.

- p5, top: the use of "1" for the identity element in G should be defined; "chi(1)" should be \chi(1)

- p5, bottom: usually a matching is a sequence of *disjoint* pairs.

- p6-7, Theorem 3.3 & 3.4: the statement and proofs of these seem to have misunderstood the randomised communication complexity model. In order to prove a lower bound on randomised communication complexity, it's sufficient to prove a lower bound on deterministic communication complexity, for protocols that succeed on at least 2/3 of the inputs (under some distribution on the inputs). This is known as the "Yao principle". So this is why lower bounds consider a deterministic message from Alice to Bob.

- p7, Theorem 3.4: O should be \Omega in the theorem; in the first line of the proof, "them" -> "him"

- p7, close to bottom: I think \hat{U}(z) = 2^{-\alpha n} if z=0, not \hat{f}(z).

- p8, first line of text: is the claim after "Note..." the right way round? It seems that for the next line of the proof you need |{y : My = s}| = 1, not |{s : My=s}| = 1, which is what the text states is true.

- p8, middle of page: \alpha-n should be \alpha n

- p10, near top: gamma should be \gamma

- bibliography: [RP95] was by Popescu and Rohrlich (not vice versa) and was published in Foundations of Physics.
